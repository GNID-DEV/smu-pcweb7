## Reflection
I enrolled in this course to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for building both web and mobile applications. Throughout the course, I've been introduced to cutting-edge technologies for web development, including Bootstrap for styling and Laravel for connecting the front-end with the back-end. There's still a lot more to explore, such as Node.js, Django, Docker, and others. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and expertise in the field of programming.
